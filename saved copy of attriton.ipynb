Why or why not?**\n","\n","Not really. Accuracy is useful, but it doesn't tell the whole story with this kind of data. Here's why:\n","\n","For Attrition, the data is super imbalanced—way more people stay (0) than leave (1). So, a model could just predict \"everyone stays\" and still get high accuracy, which wouldn’t be helpful. For Department, one department is way bigger than the others, so accuracy might just reflect the model picking the most common department.\n","\n","Instead, we should focus on:\n","\n","Precision: Helps us avoid false positives, like incorrectly predicting someone might leave their job when they're actually happy.\n","Recall: Helps us catch what really matters, like correctly identifying employees at risk of leaving.\n","F1-Score: A good balance of precision and recall, especially useful when data is uneven.\n","What really matters?\n","\n","For Attrition, recall might be the priority—you want to catch as many at-risk employees as possible to take action.\n","For Department, precision might matter more—it’s better to be sure when assigning someone to a department to avoid confusion.\n","So, while accuracy is a nice overview, these other metrics give a clearer picture of how well the model is doing.\n","\n","2. **What activation functions did you choose for your output layers, and why?**\n","\n","For Department, we used softmax. Think of it like a tie-breaker that decides between the three departments. It gives each department a probability score, and the one with the highest score wins. Plus, all the probabilities add up to 100%, which is neat and easy to interpret.\n","\n","For Attrition, we also used softmax. Now, you might think, \"Why not just use sigmoid since it’s a simple yes/no situation?\" Good question! We went with softmax for consistency—it handles probabilities the same way for both outputs, and it still works perfectly for binary classification.\n","\n","Why softmax rocks: It not only gives the final prediction but also tells us how confident the model is. For example, \"This person is 80% likely to stay and 20% likely to leave\" is much more insightful than a simple yes or no.\n","\n","3. **Can you name a few ways that this model might be improved?**\n","\n","Oh, lots of ways! Let’s break it down:\n","\n","Fix the Class Imbalance:\n","\n","Give more \"weight\" to the smaller, underrepresented groups during training so the model pays more attention to them.\n","Use techniques like SMOTE to create synthetic samples for the minority classes—kind of like evening out the playing field.\n","Get Creative with Features:\n","\n","Combine or engineer new features to highlight patterns the model might miss. It’s like looking at a puzzle from different angles—you start noticing connections you didn’t see before.\n","Upgrade the Model:\n","\n","Add more layers or neurons to make the model smarter. Think of it like giving the model a bigger brain to handle complex relationships.\n","Use dropout layers to prevent overfitting—basically forcing the model to learn how to generalize better.\n","Try Advanced Techniques:\n","\n","Switch to XGBoost or LightGBM for better performance on structured data.\n","If we’re feeling ambitious and have lots of data, we could even try Transformers for state-of-the-art results.\n","Fine-Tune the Hyperparameters:\n","\n","Adjust settings like the learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs. It’s like tweaking the knobs on a stereo to get the perfect sound.\n","Keep an Eye on Metrics:\n","\n","Focus on precision, recall, and F1-scores, not just accuracy, to make sure improvements actually help where it matters most.\n","With these tweaks, the model could perform much better, especially for the Department branch and those tricky attrition cases.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ww7LiII2AN2d"},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1Ufl-COKTtaAwNCKpeMhmWgMvrexR2p55","timestamp":1735004654658},{"file_id":"167K_kYOz5ucWNvxFeQxetqbYrYzF-ZSK","timestamp":1735004616474}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.18"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
